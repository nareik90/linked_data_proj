# linked_data_proj
Linked data and Semantic web project 2015

by Kieran Redington

This project will compare the number of crimes and there locations based
on the nearest police station and that of the country population by census
in the same year of that location. The end reult should allow us to see if an
increase in population in an area also increases crime rates and the seriousness 
of the crime. The information will be from 2004 to 2011 as there has not been
a census sence 2011.

**Datasets**
I am using two dataesets from the CSO Statbank. The first datset records the
crime, year and number of offences in that year. The other dataset is the results 
of all the nation wide census from 1841 till 2011. For our needs we will use the 
information between 2004 and 2011. The census dataset will also differentiate by sex.
